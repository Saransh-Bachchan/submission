      <h3>INTRODUCTION - THE PROBLEM!</h3>
      <p>
        On a bright sunny day, Rakshit is drenched with sweat as he is traveling
        in the hot summer month in Rajasthan. Unable to find water, Rakshit
        begins to lose his consciousness. On the brink of faintness, he somehow
        finds a hand pump in the middle of nowhere. Imagine the level of
        satisfaction he had got! Rakshit developed an idea regarding this water
        scarcity in a very economical as well as developable way, but now the
        problem begins. What can he do with this idea? Whom to approach? How to
        build the product? How to find the correct market? How to study more
        regarding this problem? Stressed by his thoughts Rakshit calls off this
        idea and again begins to worry about his campus placement. Sounds like
        another story huh? Well, this is the case with a maximum number of
        people. Every year just imagine how many brilliant ideas have the
        potential to help people and even can blow up the whole market, but are
        usually dropped off. This is just a scenario we are explaining. Now just
        imagine how many engineers are actually doing engineering? and how many
        enjoy their work? how many are well-paid? The answer to our shame is
        negligible. When will this all end? When will the ideas of various
        people be encouraged? Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present you with
        answers to all these questions with one word solution -
        "PROB-TECHNOLUTIONX".
      </p>
      <p>
        THE PLAN - THE SOLUTION PROB-TECHNOLUTIONX (PTX) is a company, platform,
        community, and even a family that works on the idea of "Appreciating
        dreams". Our basic model revolves around the idea of working, balancing,
        and trading ideas. If you think you have a great idea, we are here lets
        work on this. Now allow me to explain the work. Suppose Aditya has an
        idea for making a product let's say 'M' and he is not assure where to
        start, our team PTX comes to rescue. All he has to do is submit his idea
        and discuss it with us about the product. If the idea is feasible,
        profitable, impactive, and problem solving we will offer him a deal.
        Either he can sell his idea and prototype to us or we can make the idea
        turn into reality in partnership. For partnership, his idea and
        prototype and our labor technology and cost (if the idea sounds good).
        Once the product is made and the idea has taken shape in reality, we can
        do the business work. We can either charge him money for making ideas
        into reality or in case he can not afford us (which is a general case)
        we can do a business partnership i.e if he makes a profit of say 'X',
        then we can have a significant share of any 'J %' in it (percentage
        depends upon our work or the market capacity it can attract) or in case
        it doesn't hold much earning capacity, we can simply charge him on each
        product sold, for example, if a product is sold for 'O' amount, we can
        keep 'S' amount from 'O' (depends upon circumstances). We may provide
        our customers with all sorts of assistance required in order to turn
        their ideas into reality. Our platform would be an open place as well to
        invite investors, approach/hire/collaborate for people, sell and buy
        ideas and prototypes, and in fact the final products of our customers as
        well. People can even advertise ideas via our platform, allowing them to
        reach maximum customer potential. Having all sorts of facilities on the
        same platform people may eventually get attracted to our platform, with
        proper advertisement, we can skyrocket our company in no time. In this
        manner, we will make a profit, our client can successfully set up his
        business, an idea may be conserved, a significant impact in the world
        can be made, and whatnot! Totally a win-win situation. Benefits Ideas
        conserved fully. people will be encouraged to think out of the box.
        People will try to make significant changes in society. Lots of
        employment opportunities for millions of people People may have a direct
        connection with us, making them feel much more involved. New
        opportunities for upcoming business people to invest in multiple
        products, innovation, and company
